Code and notes for Chapter 2 - Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

# California Housing Price Prediction 

This is a practice project from Chapter 2 of the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

##  Project Objective

The goal is to build a machine learning pipeline to predict **median house values in California** using various features like location, population, income, etc.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

##  Project Structure

- `housing.csv` â†’ The dataset (California housing data)
- `housing.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook containing all code and output
- `README.md` â†’ Youâ€™re reading it!

##  What I Learned

- Handling missing values
- Data visualization and feature correlation
- Creating preprocessing pipelines
- Splitting train/test data properly
- Training a **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor**
- Evaluating model performance using **RMSE**
